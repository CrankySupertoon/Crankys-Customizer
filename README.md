# Crankys-Customizer

A stupid tool that I made back in 2015
when I didn't know what git was or 
what I was doing

The app is coded in Visual Basic but 
an early copy using AutoHotKey is 
somewhere.

I lost the source ages ago so here is
A decompile. Feel free to use this
crappy code from an 12 year old idiot
